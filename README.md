# ðŸ§± 3D Stack Game

A minimal 3D stack game built for Android using Unity. This project replicates the classic stack-building mechanic seen in popular mobile games, where players must align falling blocks as precisely as possible to build a tower.

---

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

- Tap the screen to drop a moving block on top of the stack.
- The goal is to align each block perfectly.
- Any overhang is sliced off â€” the block gets smaller each time.
- The game ends when the stack becomes too small to continue.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project

This game was developed to explore and understand key Unity concepts:

- Object movement and timing
- Overlap detection and slicing logic
- Game state handling (start, play, fail)
- UI elements and score tracking
- Mobile input handling (tap-based controls)
- Performance optimization for Android

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (3D)
- **C#** for scripting
- Target Platform: **Android**

## âœ… What I Learned

- How to implement precise block placement logic
- Handling object slicing and scaling dynamically
- Managing game loops and state transitions
- Basics of mobile tap detection in Unity
- Optimizing render performance for mobile devices
